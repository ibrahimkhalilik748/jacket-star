                <h5>Protect from the elements in style and comfort.</h5>
                <p>The fact is, perfect working conditions are not always possible. As a result, having a quality (okay, and fun!) A running jacket to stay safe in any weather is as important as sturdy running shoes.</p>
                <p>How do you buy a good running jacket, you ask? The best running jackets should feel comfortable when walking and provide adequate ventilation (i.e., allow air to pass through so you do not get mad-sweating and feel too hot). They should also act as a windbreaker and can be waterproof or water-resistant to keep you dry and warm.</p>
                <p>The technical elements aside, you will want to look for another exegete slightly on the shoulders so you can pump your arms. (The most important part of being a better runner, BTW.)</p>
                <p>The Nike Essential Hooded Running Jacket is as the name implies: it is important. At a reasonable price compared to other running jackets, it has a protective cover for the elements on your face, details the design of the air to keep you from overheating, and is packed if you need to take it off and store it in a warm place. in a pocket or running belt. Oh, and it looks so good with the romping around the city on rescue days, too.</p>
                <p>Average rating: 4.5 / 5</p>
                <p>Rave Update: Good quality, very lightweight and very effective in keeping the air out and easy drip. It is good for walking and running. It has spaces in the back so I don’t sweat. Cuffs have velcro for strength. I would like to stretch but [velcro] works. A good purchase and a good value for money.</p>
