                <p>If you kill in a tracksuit, make sure we have plenty of time to try it — in fact, it may be here for a long time. Consider the evidence: The 1990s and early 1900s were trending everywhere you look; Vetements track and athletic pieces fly off the shelves (with inspiring copycats); and the new creative director of Juicy Couture, Jamie Mizrahi, is already making twisted track skirts and jackets for influential designers like Katy Perry and Sasha Lane. Valentino even had tracksuits (and track clothes) at his Resort 2018 show.</p>

                <p>The tracksuit embedded in the current zeitgeist, in fact, is easy to forget its divisive, cheap startups. Now, it’s just a cooler thing than a T-shirt and jeans — but can you wear them when you work? Contrary to popular belief, but mixed with the appropriate smooth, architectural pieces (read: non-sports) in your wardrobe, we think the answer is yes. First, jump from head to toe — which may cool down to 9 to 5 — and combine different colors, patterns, and textures. For example, a black track jacket can make down stretchable bubblegum-pink trousers, while velvet pants and calf-length sandals can enhance an Adidas basic zipper. And while there is time and space for tracksuits with sneakers, it is safe to say that the office is not; swap Vans with a pair of sensible block heels.</p>
