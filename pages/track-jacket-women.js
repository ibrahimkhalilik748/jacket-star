                <p>Buyers love the way this jacket works, from everyday wear to travel. I wore this for the first time on a recent whale watching trip and I love it! I kept it warm and dry, without too much heat, on a windy day in the water. I will buy it again, writes one reviewer.</p>


                <p>One reviewer stated that the proper layer of coat is on rainy days. LOVE! This jacket is exactly the simple layer I was looking for. We just moved to Portland and I was looking for something that could withstand the rains and the wind without being too heavy.</p>

                <p>Amazon buyers scoff at the puffer Track Jacket Women, giving it approximately five thousand star ratings. I bought this coat to travel to the south of France in late November and the cold rainy days in North Carolina. It’s perfect for temperatures in the 40s to 50s, and the hood works well in the rain, writes one reviewer, adding. It folds down into a tight space, making it comfortable for walking.</p>

                <p>One reviewer emphasized how well the coat lasts in winter. The coat fits well and has all the features I wanted: a hood, deep pockets, and most importantly, a double zipper, they wrote. The zippered bottom of my last coat just broke because it was too tight when I was sitting in the car, which I do a lot! Now with the lower end of the zipper, I can open it slightly to remove the pressure on the bottom tab.</p>
